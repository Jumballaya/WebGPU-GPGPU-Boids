# The Boids

Based on the concept created by Craig Reynolds in 1986. [Boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) simulates the flocking behavior of birds using 3 simple rules.

1. Alignment: Boids will steer towards the average heading of local flockmates
2. Cohesion: Boids will steer towards the average position of local flockmates
3. Separation: Boids will steer to avoid getting to close to local flockmates
